The project Nurture is an agricultural software that works with NASA’s soil moisture portal data, MODIS, SMAP, Tree canopy and Vegetation data from NASA’s Earth Observation and Geoglam crop monitor
data for guiding the farmers and agricultural professionals with precise and data-driven insight for crop planning. Additionally, it features a chatbot for real-time assistance and predictive crop
yield forecasting. By integrating the temperature, rainfall and soil type parameters, Nurture revolutionizes the way crops are chosen and cultivated, enhancing plant production and resource efficiency.
Here we have used python libraries such as pandas, Flask, Request, Sklearn, and linear regrassion to achieve our desired output. Here the main file contains the code that predicts the crop suitability 
using the sample datasets land_data.csv and crop_suitability_data.csv. The treecanopymain code contrains the prediction of tree canopy.
